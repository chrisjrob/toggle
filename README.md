Toggle
======

Description
-----------

OpenSCAD design for a shock cord toggle.

This is a toggle that would go on each end of a length of bungee cord. In particular it is designed to replace the toggles that you get on rubber dinghies to hold the oars in place.

Currently set to 10mm radius, for a maximum 6mm cord.

Instructions
------------

Download and edit the .scad file with your chosen parameters. Only the toggle radius needs changing, as the rest are pre-set based on that, but you can edit any of the global variables as you wish.

Generate STL and Gcodes in the normal way and print using your 3D printer.

Cut bungee cord to length and insert through hole.

Tie a tight knot in the end with the large hole and pull knot into the body of the toggle.
Insert the bung in the large hole (you may need to glue in place).
